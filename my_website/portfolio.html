<h1><b>Python Graph Data Project </b></h1>
	 <p>This is a python project where we took data and made a graph from it. Jason was my partner, who was very difficult to work with initialy. However, we overcame our differences and accepted each other for who we really are. Now we are best friends and I only have Mr. Dunlea to thank for that. I really enjoyed working on this project and creating intriguing ways to display data. I expect nothing less than an A.</p>

<h1><b>NetLogo Project</b></h1>
	 <p>In this project we asked how does a 3d Surface move. We took a simulation from NetLogo, modified the code, and analyzed the effects it had. The non modified version is on the left. The modified version is on the right where, within the code, I changed the shape of the turtles to hearts, the color of them to pink, and the speed at which they moved . (Click on either image to see the original simulation)</p>
